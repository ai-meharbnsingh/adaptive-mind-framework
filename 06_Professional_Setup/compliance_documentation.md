# Adaptive Mind Framework - Compliance Posture & Readiness

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance-friendly posture of the Adaptive Mind Framework. While the IP itself is not formally certified (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA), it has been built from the ground up using enterprise-ready principles that enable an acquirer to rapidly achieve formal certification within their own compliant environments.

## Core Compliance-Ready Features

1.  **Compliant-Ready Hosting:**
    -   The live demo is hosted on Render.com, which is built on top of major cloud providers (AWS/GCP) that maintain SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA compliance for their underlying infrastructure.
    -   The production deployment scripts target **Microsoft Azure**, a leading enterprise cloud with a comprehensive compliance portfolio.

2.  **Data Security & Encryption:**
    -   **In-Transit:** All web traffic is enforced over HTTPS using industry-standard SSL/TLS encryption.
    -   **At-Rest (Database):** The production PostgreSQL database is configured for encryption at rest within Azure.

3.  **Secure Handling of Sensitive Data:**
    -   The **Buyer Evaluation Mode** was specifically designed with enterprise security in mind. Buyer API keys are handled **in-memory only** and are never persisted to disk, a critical requirement for SOC 2 compliance.
    -   Sessions for buyer keys are designed to be ephemeral with automatic, timed expiration.

4.  **Audit & Logging Capabilities:**
    -   The framework includes a comprehensive telemetry and logging system.
    -   Security-critical events, such as API key validation and demo execution, are designed to generate structured logs, forming the basis of an immutable audit trail required for compliance.

## Path to Certification for an Acquirer

An acquiring company can leverage these built-in features to accelerate their own certification process:
- The **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** scripts for Azure provide a version-controlled, auditable, and repeatable deployment process.
- The **logging architecture** can be immediately integrated with an enterprise SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.
- The **secure key handling** model already meets key control objectives for standards like SOC 2.
