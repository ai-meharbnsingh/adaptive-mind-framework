# Adaptive Mind Framework - Business & IP Sales Structure

## Overview

This document outlines the current business structure and the recommended path for the sale of the Adaptive Mind Framework IP.

## Current Business Structure

- **Entity Type:** Individual / Sole Proprietorship.
- **Rationale:** This is the most efficient and cost-effective structure for the IP development phase, focusing all resources on creating the technical and business assets.

## Recommended IP Acquisition Path

1.  **Asset Purchase Agreement:** The most straightforward path for an acquisition is for a corporate buyer to acquire the IP assets directly from the creator via an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA).

2.  **Formation of an Entity (Optional, upon LOI):** Upon receiving a Letter of Intent (LOI) from a serious buyer, it is recommended to consult with legal and financial advisors to form a legal entity (e.g., an LLC or S-Corp) to facilitate the transaction. This provides liability protection and can offer significant tax advantages.

## Key Assets for Sale

The acquisition includes, but is not limited to:
- The `adaptive-mind.com` domain name.
- The complete source code repository.
- All production-ready Azure deployment scripts (Infrastructure as Code).
- All documentation, including development logs, strategic plans, and these professional setup documents.
- The brand logo and associated marketing materials.

**Disclaimer:** This is a strategic outline, not legal or financial advice. Consultation with qualified professionals is required to execute a formal transaction.
