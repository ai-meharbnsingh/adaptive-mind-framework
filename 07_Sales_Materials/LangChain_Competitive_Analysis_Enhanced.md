```python
# LangChain failover - falls back to static templates
if provider_fails:
    return predetermined_template_response  # Business logic lost
```

**Adaptive Mind's Full AI Recovery:**
```python
# Adaptive Mind - maintains full AI capabilities
if provider_fails:
    context = preserve_conversation_state()
    new_provider = intelligent_provider_selection()
    return full_ai_response_with_context(context, new_provider)
```

### 2. Security Architecture Comparison

**LangChain Security Model:**
