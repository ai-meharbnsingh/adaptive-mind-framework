# üß† Project Context Summary (Last Updated: 2025-08-27 UTC)

## üéØ Current Goal:
Complete Phase 1 by achieving a 100% stable and passing test suite after a major architectural refactor.

## üìà Recent Progress:
- **Merged Performance Branch:** Successfully merged the `feature/performance-benchmarking` branch, consolidating the performance testing suite and its findings into the main development line.
- **Architectural Hardening:** Refactored the `FailoverEngine` to be fully extensible via a new `ProviderRegistry`, removing hard-coded dependencies. This is a critical improvement for commercial viability. The `ErrorParser` was also made more robust with a dedicated `MODEL_ISSUE` category.
- **Robust Test Environment:** After extensive debugging, resolved a critical testing blocker by implementing a reliable `.env` and launcher script (`run_server.py`) strategy. The server can now be started in "production" or "performance test" mode with 100% reliability.
- **Sales-Focused Documentation:** Created and then completely rewrote the foundational commercial document (`docs/commercial/framework_overview.md`) to be a compelling, sales-oriented asset based on expert feedback.
- **Test Suite Hardening:** Fixed a cascade of test failures related to test isolation and architectural changes. All 95 tests related to the providers and core logic outside of the `FailoverEngine` are now passing.

## üöß Current Challenges/Blockers:
- **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** The test suite is **not stable**. The `test_failover_engine.py` file has multiple failures stemming from a flawed mocking strategy for the `ResourceGuard` fixture that was introduced during the final code review. This must be resolved before Phase 1 can be considered complete.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Steps & Immediate Focus:
- **Resolve the Final Test Failures:** The absolute top priority is to diagnose and implement a definitive, stateless mock for the `ResourceGuard` in `test_failover_engine.py` to get the entire suite to 100% green.
- **Complete Phase 1 Code Review:** Once the test suite is passing, officially sign off on the Phase 1 code review.
