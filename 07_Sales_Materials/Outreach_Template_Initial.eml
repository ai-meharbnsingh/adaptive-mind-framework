## üìß **Template 6: Objection Handling - "Too Expensive"**

### **Email Body**

---

**Subject:** ROI analysis: why the cost of NOT implementing is higher

Hi [Prospect Name],

I understand cost is always a consideration for any enterprise investment. Let me share a perspective that helped [Similar Company] make this decision.

**Cost of Status Quo:**
Based on [Company Name]'s current AI spending of $[Amount]/month:
- **Unoptimized costs:** $[Amount] annually in avoidable spending
- **Downtime risk:** $43K per hour during provider outages
- **Manual processes:** $[Amount] in operational overhead

**Annual "Hidden Costs":** $[Total Amount]

**Implementation Investment:** $150,000 (one-time)

**The Math:**
- Your current hidden costs: $[Amount]/year
- Implementation cost: $150,000
- **You're already spending** the equivalent of our implementation cost every [time period] in inefficiencies

**Alternative Comparison:**
Building similar capabilities internally:
- Development: $2.1M over 18 months
- Ongoing maintenance: $924K annually
- **3-year total:** $3.3M vs. our $222K

**Customer Example:**
[Similar Company] was initially concerned about cost. After implementation:
- **Monthly savings:** $67,000 (paid for itself in 2.2 months)
- **CFO quote:** "Best infrastructure investment we've made in years"

**Would you like to see** a detailed cost-benefit analysis specific to [Company Name]'s situation?

Best regards,

**Meharban Singh**
